# Fruit Classification Using Deep Learning

This repository includes a Deep Learning project in which I classified fruit varieties using the ['Fruits 360' dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits). This dataset contains 90,483 images of fruits and vegetables. 

I undertook the following steps in this project:
- Data Aquisition
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Constructing a baseline model (84% accuracy)
- Applying Data Augmentation in training the baseline model (90% accuracy)
- Transfer Learning (89% accuracy)
- Creating a hybrid of the baseline model and transfer learning models using Keras' Functional API (96% accuracy)
- Displaying the images, labels, and model predictions for samples that were consistently predicted incorrectly.
